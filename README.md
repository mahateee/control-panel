# control-panel
This is a project I created for Smart Methods company , a control panel for the base of the robotic arm. The page consists of five buttons, which indicate the directions in which the base of the robotic arm is moving.
Steps for this project:
1.Structure the interface by HTML.
2.Interface formatting by CSS.
3.Create a database with SQL.
4.Connecting the database to the interface by creating a code by PHP.
5.connect the page of the first task that controls the robot arm and the page that controls the base of the arm via a button on both pages.
